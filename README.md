# Personal Introduction Site

This repository hosts a simple static website used for self-introduction. The page is written in Japanese and showcases basic information such as your university affiliation, research interests, and contact details.

## Purpose

The project demonstrates how to build a lightweight personal page with minimal dependencies. It can be easily customized to present your own profile or portfolio.

## Viewing the Site

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.
3. No server is required; the site is entirely static.

Styling is provided by `index.css`, which is linked from `index.html`.

## Project Structure

- `index.html` – The main page containing sections for Home, Self Introduction, University, Research Field, and Contact.
- `index.css` – Style rules for layout, colors, and responsive design.
- `README.md` – Project documentation (this file).

## Customization

- **Content**: Edit `index.html` to change headings, paragraphs, or links. Each section is clearly labeled with an `id` for navigation.
- **Appearance**: Adjust `index.css` to modify fonts, colors, spacing, and layout. The CSS uses simple selectors, so basic knowledge of CSS is sufficient.
- **Images**: If you want to add photos or graphics, place them in the repository and reference them from `index.html`.

## Deployment

Because everything is static, you can host the site on any platform that serves HTML files. GitHub Pages is a common choice:

1. Push the repository to GitHub.
2. Enable GitHub Pages for the repository.
3. Visit the generated URL to see your site online.
